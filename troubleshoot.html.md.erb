    symptom: "When you run <code>#{vars.product_cli} offer save</code>, you see an error similar to the following:
    <pre class='terminal'> helm.sh/hook: crd-install found in [Chart1, Chart2....] but no Helm /crds dir; this looks like a Helm 2 only chart </pre>",
    cause:  vars.product_short  + ' supports charts that use the Helm 2 and Helm 3 CLIs.
    However, Helm 2 and Helm 3 use different methods to install Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs).
    <br><br>If a Helm 2 chart does not define CRDs using both methods, adding or
    updating the service offering might fail.',
