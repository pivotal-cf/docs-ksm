| workload cluster |  The cluster in which Tanzu Service Manager provisions services |

|private container image registry| Container registries can be public or private. VMware recommends using **private** container registries. |
|public container image registry| If you mean "public container registry" or "private container registry" say so, at least on first use in the paragraph. Don't assume that the reader/learner knows which you mean. Don't shorten to "public registry" or "private registry". |
