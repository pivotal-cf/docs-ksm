This topic describes how to use Kubernetes Service Manager (KSM) for PCF.

##<a id='using'></a> Overview

KSM for PCF uses the `bazaar` CLI and a generic broker deployed by the tile.
You can use KSM for PCF to do the following:

+ Offer on demand provisioning of a dedicated service instance for developers through `cf marketplace`.
See [Use with Dedicated Service Instances](#dedicated) below.
+ Install a Helm chart for a shared service instance or add-on.
See [Use with Shared Instances and Add-ons](#shared-add-on) below.


###<a id="prereq"></a>Prerequisite

Before you use KSM for PCF, you must do the following:

1. Configure your Helm chart according to the Helm chart provider's documentation.
Each Helm chart most likely needs some service configuration.
1. Configure your Helm chart to be compatible with KSM for PCF.
See [Configure your Helm Chart](#config-helm)

###<a id='config-helm'></a> Configure your Helm Chart

To configure your Helm chart to be compatible with KSM for PCF, do the following:

1. Open the `values.yaml` file at the root level of your chart.

1. Edit your `values.yaml` file as follows:
    + Change the `service:` `type:` value from `ClusterIP` to `LoadBalancer`.
    + Edit the `storageClass:` value to correspond to the storageClass name for
    your configured Pivotal Container Service (PKS)
    cluster. The default name for PKS is `standard`.
      For more information,
      see [Configuring and Using PersistentVolumes](https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/volumes.html).

    For example:

    ```
    persistence:
      enabled: true
      storageClass: "standard"
      ...
    service:
      type: LoadBalancer
      port: 3306
    ```

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> You cannot change the chart name or
   resize a PersistentVolumeClaim after you add the service offering to KSM for PCF. </p>

For examples of Kubernetes compatible charts,
see [kibosh-sample](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/kibosh-sample/blob/master/sample-charts) on GitHub.


## <a id='dedicated'></a> Use with Dedicated Service Instances

Dedicated instances are provided through a service broker installed by the Kubernetes Service Manager
for PCF tile.

When a Pivotal Application Service (PAS) developer runs `cf create-service`
the broker creates a dedicated service instance of the service in the backing cluster. For more
information about the `cf create-service` command,
see [Creating Service Instances](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/managing-services.html#create)
in the Cloud Foundry documentation.

To provision a dedicated service instance offering based on a Helm Chart for app developers,
do the following:

2. Define plans if you want to offer customized plans and override the default values.
   See [(Optional) Define Plans](#plans), below.
1. Load container images into a private registry if your environment is air gapped.
   See [(Optional) Load Container Images](#images), below.
1. Create environment variables for app consumption.
   See [(Optional) Create Environment Variables for App Consumption](#env), below.
1. Add the service offering to KSM for PCF.
   See [Add a Service Offering Kubernetes Service Manager for PCF](#add), below.
1. Enable service offering access.
   See [Enable Service Offering Access](#enable), below.

###<a id='plans'></a> (Optional) Define Plans

In `cf marketplace`, each service has a set of plans that developers can provision.
A plan is a template for service instances.
For example, different plans might represent a large or a small instance of a database.

For Kubernetes services, each KSM plan represents a set of values overriding the Helm chart's default
values.
These values are configured in `plans.yaml` at the root level of your chart.

For example charts that have been configured for KSM,
see [kibosh-sample](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/kibosh-sample/blob/master/sample-charts) on GitHub.

If you want to override the default settings in `values.yaml` and offer custom plans, do the following:

1. Create a `plans` subdirectory at the root level of your chart

1. Create and edit `plans/PLAN-FILE.yaml` with the Helm values that you want to override.
   `PLAN-FILE.yaml` must consist of only lowercase letters, digits, `.`, or `-`.
    <br><br>
    Ensure that the properties you add to `PLAN-FILE.yaml` match the properties in `values.yaml`
    and that you only change the values.
    <br><br>
    For example:

    ```
    ---
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: 128Mi
        cpu: 100m
    ```

1. Create a `plans.yaml` file at the root level of your chart.

1. Edit your `plans.yaml` file to add your custom plan information using the following template:

    ```
    - name: PLAN-NAME
      description: PLAN-DESCRIPTION
      file: PLAN-FILE
    ```

    Where:
    * `PLAN-NAME` is the name of the plan that developers when they run `cf marketplace`.
       Ensure that the plan name is lowercase only and contains no special characters.
    * `PLAN-DESCRIPTION` is the description that developers when they run `cf marketplace`.
    * `PLAN-FILE` is the name of the plan file in the `plans` subdirectory.

    For example:

    ```
    - name: "small"
      description: "default (small) plan for mysql"
      file: "small.yaml"
    - name: "medium"
      description: "medium sized plan for mysql"
      file: "medium.yaml"
    ```

      For example charts that have been configured for KSM, see
[kibosh-sample](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/kibosh-sample/blob/master/sample-charts) on GitHub.


###<a id='images'></a> (Optional) Load Container Images

You need to load container images into a private registry if either of the following apply:

+ Your environment is air gapped and cannot connect to common registries such as
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and
[Quay](https://quay.io/)
+ The images referenced in the Helm chart are not public

You must load the images before a developer runs `cf create-service`.

To load your container images follow instructions for your specific registry.
Harbor [instructions](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/blob/master/docs/user_guide.md#pulling-and-pushing-images-using-docker-client)


###<a id='env'></a> (Optional) Create Environment Variables for App Consumption

Apps running in PCF gain access to bound service instances through an environment
variable credentials hash called `VCAP_SERVICES`. Libraries, like Spring Cloud
Cloud Foundry Connector,
automatically support services if their credentials in `VCAP_SERVICES` are formatted
in a valid JSON object.

For an example of the requirements for using Spring Cloud
Cloud Foundry Connector with a MySQL service, see
[MySQL](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-connectors/spring-cloud-cloud-foundry-connector.html#_mysql)
in the Spring Cloud Cloud Foundry Connector documentation.

Chart authors can create a `bind.yaml` file to enable the broker to
return a valid JSON object containing service credentials. This `bind.yaml` file is added
to the root directory of the chart and contains a Jsonnet template.
When a developer binds the service instance to their app,
service credentials are delivered to `VCAP_SERVICES` for app consumption.

For information about Jsonnet templates, see [Jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org).

To create and test a `bind.yaml` file, do the following:

1. Add a `bind.yaml` file to the root directory of your chart.
    For example, the following `bind.yaml` enables the broker to return
    MySQL credentials in a valid JSON obejct:

    ```yaml
    template: |
      {
        hostname: $.services[0].status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip,
        name: $.services[0].name,
        jdbcUrl: "jdbc:mysql://" + self.hostname + "/my_db?user=" + self.username + "&password=" + self.password + "&useSSL=false",
        uri: "mysql://" + self.username + ":" + self.password + "@" + self.hostname + ":" + self.port + "/my_db?reconnect=true",
        password: $.secrets[0].data['mysql-root-password'],
        port: 3306,
        username: "root"
      }
    ```
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The values of <code>$.services</code> and <code>$.secrets</code>
      are returned by Kubernetes.</p>

1. Download the `template-tester` binary from
[kibosh](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/kibosh/releases/latest) in GitHub.

1. Test that `bind.yaml` is creating a valid JSON object by running the following command:

    ```
    template-tester NAMESPACE bind.yaml
    ```

    Where `NAMESPACE` is the name of the namespace in your cluster where
    your chart is deployed.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ template-tester default bind.yaml    
      {
       "hostname": "192.168.1.1",
       "jdbcUrl": "jdbc:mysql<span>:</span>//192.168.1.1/my&#95;db?user=root&password=ab1cdeFgH3IJKLMN&useSSL=false",
       "name": "kibosh-46588108-0ba5-47c0-ba97-bd76e33af0d1-grafana",
       "password": "ab1cdeFgH3IJKLMN",
       "port": 3306,
       "uri": "mysql://root<span>:</span>ab1cdeFgH3IJKLMN@192.168.1.1:3306/my&#95;db?reconnect=true",
       "username": "root"
      }</pre>

### <a id="add"></a> Add a Service Offering to Kubernetes Service Manager for PCF

After you configure your Helm chart for KSM for PCF you must package it and
add the offering to KSM for PCF to let developers use it.
To add your offering to KSM for PCF, do the following:

1. To package your Helm chart, run the following command from the root level of
your Helm chart directory:

    ```
    helm package .
    ```

    Verify that you now have a file named `CHART-NAME-#.#.#.tgz` in the root level of your
    Helm chart directory.

1. Navigate to the **Ops Manager Installation Dashboard** > **Kubernetes Service Manager for PCF** > **Credentials**.

1. Retrieve your **Bazaar API Credentials** by clicking **Link to Credentials**.

1. Record the values for `identity` and `password`.

1. To add the Helm chart as a dedicated instance service offering to KSM for PCF, run the following
command:

    ```
    bazaar -t http://bazaar.SYSTEM-DOMAIN -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD offer save /PATH-TO-YOUR-CHART.tgz
    ```
    Where:
    + `SYSTEM-DOMAIN` is your PCF system domain URL.
    + `USERNAME` is the value of `identity` you recorded in step 3.
    + `PASSWORD` is the value of `password` you recorded in step 3.
    + `PATH-TO-YOUR-CHART.tgz` is the path to the packaged chart created in step 1.


1. To ensure your offering has been saved to KSM for PCF, run the following command:

    ```
    bazaar -t  http://bazaar.SYSTEM-DOMAIN -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD offer list
    ```
    Where:
    + `SYSTEM-DOMAIN` is your PCF system domain URL.
    + `USERNAME` is the value of `identity` you recorded in step 3.
    + `PASSWORD` is the value of `password` you recorded in step 3.

### <a id="enable"></a> Enable Service Offering Access

After you add your service offering, you must enable access to the service offering.
To enable access to your service offering, do the following:

1. To log in to your PAS deployment, do the following:

    ```
    cf login -a API-URL -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD
    ```

    Where:
    + `API-URL` is the API endpoint for your PAS instance.
    + `USERNAME` is your username for your PAS instance.
    + `PASSWORD` is your password for your PAS instance.

    For more information,
    see [Getting Started with the cf CLI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/cf-cli/getting-started.html#login).

1. To enable access to the service for all orgs, run the following command:

    ```
    cf enable-service-access SERVICE-NAME
    ```
    Where `SERVICE-NAME` is the name of the new service that you viewed in step 6 of
    [Add a Service Offering to Kubernetes Service Manager for PCF](#add) above.


1. To view the newly created service plan, run the following command:

    ```
    cf marketplace
    ```

### <a id="delete"></a> Delete a Service Offering

If you want to delete a service offering, do the following:

1. To view the current service offerings available in KSM for PCF, run the following command:

    ```
    bazaar -t  http://bazaar.SYSTEM-DOMAIN -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD offer list
    ```
    Where:
    + `SYSTEM-DOMAIN` is your PCF system domain URL.
    + `USERNAME` is the value of `identity` you recorded in step 3 of
    [Add a Service Offering to Kubernetes Service Manager for PCF](#add) above.
    + `PASSWORD` is the value of `password` you recorded in step 3 of
    [Add a Service Offering to Kubernetes Service Manager for PCF](#add) above.


1. To delete a service offering, run the following command:

    ```
    bazaar -t  http://bazaar.SYSTEM-DOMAIN -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD offer delete YOUR-CHART
    ```
    Where:
    + `SYSTEM-DOMAIN` is your PCF system domain URL.
    + `USERNAME` is the value of `identity` you recorded in step 3 of
    [Add a Service Offering to Kubernetes Service Manager for PCF](#add) above.
    + `PASSWORD` is the value of `password` you recorded in step 3 of [
    Add a Service Offering to Kubernetes Service Manager for PCF](#add) above.
    + `YOUR-CHART` is the name of the service offering you want to delete that you viewed in step 1.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you only have one service offering in KSM for PCF, you
      cannot delete it.</p>


##<a id='shared-add-on'></a> Use with Shared Instances and Add-ons
Shared service instances and add-ons are installed directly onto a PKS cluster.
These services are not automatically available to a PAS developer through `cf marketplace`.

To install a Helm chart for a shared service instance or cluster add-on, do the following:

1. To log in to the PKS cluster, run the following command:

    ```
    pks login -a PKS-API -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD
    ```

    Where:
    + `PKS-API` is the domain name for the PKS API entered in **Ops Manager >
       Pivotal Container Service > PKS API > API Hostname (FQDN)**.
       For example: `api.pks.example.com`.
    + `USERNAME` is the username you created in
    [Grant Enterprise PKS Access to a User](https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/manage-users.html#uaa-user).
    + `PASSWORD` is the password you created in
    [Grant Enterprise PKS Access to a User](https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/manage-users.html#uaa-user).
       If you do not provide a password, the CLI prompts for the password interactively.
       Pivotal recommends that you run the login command without the `-p` flag for added security.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you are using self-signed certificates, you can include the <code>-k</code> flag</p>

1. To retrieve and record the Helm and Ops Manager client credentials, do the following:

    1. Navigate to the **Ops Manager Installation Dashboard > Kubernetes Service Manager > Credentials**.

    1. Click **Link to Credentials** next to Helm Client Certificate.

    1.  Record the `cert_pem` and `private_kep_pem` credential in local files.
        You need the paths to these files for the `bazaar chart install` command
        and to configure TLS communication with Tiller.

    1. To retrieve the Ops Manager CA certificate,
    download the certificate from `https://OPS-MAN-FQDN/download_root_ca_cert`.

      <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You can also use the following environment variables to
        set up the file paths for TLS configuration:
         <code>HELM\_CERT\_FILE</code>, <code>HELM\_TLS\_KEY\_FILE</code>,
         and <code>TILLER\_TLS\_CA\_CERT\_FILE</code>.</p>

1. To package your Helm chart, run the following command from the root level of your Helm chart directory:

      ```
      helm package .
      ```

      Verify that you now have a file named `CHART-NAME-#.#.#.tgz` in the root level of your Helm
      chart directory.

1. To install a Helm chart for a shared instance service on a PKS cluster, run the following command:

    ```
    bazaar chart install -d CHART-DIRECTORY -c PKS-CLUSTER -n SERVICE-NAME \
     --tls-cert HELM-CERT-FILE \
    --tls-key HELM-TLS-KEY-FILE --tls-ca-cert TILLER-TLS-CA-CERT-FILE
    ```

    Where:
    + `CHART-DIRECTORY` is the file directory for your Helm chart.
    + `PKS-CLUSTER` is the cluster you configured when you installed the Kubernetes Service Manager tile.
    + `SERVICE-NAME` is the name of the service you want to create.
    + `HELM-CERT-FILE` is the path to the TLS client certificate file with the `cert_pem` credential
    you obtained in step 2c.
    + `HELM-TLS-KEY-FILE` is the path to the TLS client key file with the `private_kep_pem` credential
    you obtained in step 2c.
    + `TILLER-TLS-CA-CERT-FILE` is the path to the TLS CA certificate file with the Ops Manager CA
    certificate you obtained in 2d.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you want to override default Helm chart values with custom
      values, run the above command with <code>-f values.yaml</code>. You configure custom values in
      <code>values.yaml</code>. For examples of modified <code>values.yaml</code> files,
      see <a href="https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/kibosh-sample/blob/master/sample-charts">kibosh-sample</a>
      in GitHub.</p>

    After your Helm chart is installed, KSM for PCF outputs
    information about the new service. The output depends on the Helm chart you are installing.
