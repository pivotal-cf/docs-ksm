This topic is an overview of <%= vars.product_full %> (<%= vars.product_short %>).


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

<%= vars.product_full %> (<%= vars.product_short %>) is a feature within
<%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) that enables operators
to provide app developers with access to services through the `cf marketplace`.
These services run on Kubernetes clusters such as those created with <%= vars.k8s_runtime_full %>
for consumption by <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> apps.
<%= vars.product_short %> is available to all customers who use <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>.

<%= vars.product_short %> enables platform operators to:

* Offer ISV and open-source Helm charts as on-demand services to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>
developers.

<%= vars.product_short %> enables app developers to:

* Provision dedicated service instances onto a Kubernetes cluster through the `cf marketplace`.
* Consume services running on <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> in apps running on
<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>.


## <a id='features'></a> Key Features

<%= vars.product_short %> includes the following key features:

* A service broker that provisions dedicated service instances into a
Kubernetes cluster and binds service instances to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> apps.
* A Command Line Interface (CLI) for managing service offerings.

see [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_full %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/pks/index.html).


## <a id="limitations"></a> Limitations

Dedicated service instances created by <%= vars.product_short %> either provision
an IaaS load balancer or use an ingress controller for ingress into each service instance.
You cannot use ClusterIP for ingress.
