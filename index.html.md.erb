This topic is an overview of <%= vars.product_full %> (<%= vars.product_short %>).

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

 <%= vars.product_short %> enables operators
to provide app developers with access to services through the `cf marketplace`.
These services run on Kubernetes clusters such as those created with <%= vars.k8s_runtime_full %>
for consumption by <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) apps.

For more information about the `cf marketplace`,
see [Developer Guide](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-5/devguide/index.html).
For more information about <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>,
see [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_full %>](https://pivotal.io/platform/pivotal-container-service).

<%= vars.product_short %> enables platform operators to do the following:

* Offer ISV and open source Helm charts as on-demand services to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> developers.

<%= vars.product_short %> enables app developers to do the following:

* Provision dedicated service instances onto a Kubernetes cluster through the `cf marketplace`.
* Consume services running on <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> in apps running on <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>.

## <a id='features'></a> Key Features

<%= vars.product_short %> includes the following key features:

* A service broker that provisions dedicated service instances into a
Kubernetes cluster and binds service instances to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> apps.
* A Command Line Interface (CLI) for managing service offerings.
* The ability to create and manage a catalog of services to the `cf marketplace`.

## <a id="reqs"></a>Requirements

<%= vars.product_short %> requires the following:

* **<%= vars.product_short %> CLI:** For information about installing the <%= vars.product_short %> CLI, see
[Install the <%= vars.product_short %> CLI](./installing.html#cli) .
* **Helm 3 CLI:** For information about installing the Helm CLI,
see the [Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/).
* **Docker CLI:** For information about installing Docker, see [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
* **<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Deployment:** A running <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment.
* **Kubernetes Cluster:** A running Kubernetes cluster. <%= vars.product_short %> supports <%= vars.k8s_runtime_full %> clusters. For information
about <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, see [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_full %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/pks/index.html).
* **S3 Compatible Storage:** <%= vars.product_short %> requires a S3-compatible bucket to store offered charts and the chart cache.
For more information, see [Configuring External Storage](./storage.html).
* **Private Container Registry:** You need this to manage container images
in air-gapped environments.
  VMware recommends using a private container registry in production deployments.
  You can use a private container registry such as
  [Harbor](https://network.pivotal.io/products/harbor-container-registry).

## <a id="limitations"></a>Limitations

Dedicated service instances created by <%= vars.product_short %> either provision
an IaaS load balancer or use an ingress controller for ingress into each service instance.
You cannot use ClusterIP for ingress.
